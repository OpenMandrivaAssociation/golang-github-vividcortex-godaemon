%global common_description %{expand:
Daemonize Go applications with exec() instead of fork().

You can't daemonize the usual way in Go. Daemonizing is a Unix concept that 
requires some specific things you can't do easily in Go. But you can still 
accomplish the same goals if you don't mind that your program will start 
copies of itself several times, as opposed to using fork() the way many 
programmers are accustomed to doing.}
